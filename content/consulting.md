# Consulting Engagements #
I have extensive experience in deploying, automating, and securing corporate IT systems. For example automating employee onboarding/offboarding, deploying Single Sign On, implementing account security best practices, and Zero Trust (e.g. microsegmentation, scoped access, device attestation, hardware backed authentication). I offer fixed task or time engagements as well as ongoing engagement options.
