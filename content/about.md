I am currently a manager of Duo Labs at Duo Security. Previously, I was the IT Infrastructure Manager at Cloudflare, a Corporate Operations Engineer at Google, and owned and operated EZap Technology, an Internet services and consulting company. I have a variety of interests including technology, web design, video production, magic, music, graphic design, and more.

This portfolio showcases some of my recent work. I have also published my résumé for perusal. I am currently available for both consulting and creative projects.
