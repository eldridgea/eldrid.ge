<center><h1>Learnings</h1></center>

<center><h3>Just a list of stuff I've learned in no particular order</h3></center>

1. Stay hydrated.

1. Wear sunscreen, on your face everyday if you can.

1. You regret what you didn't do more than what you did, so make mistakes. Big ones. 

1. Negative emotions are important and a part of you, learn how to process them. Speak *for* your emotions not *from* them. 

1. Stretch and be active everyday, that doesn't mean 90 minutes at the gym necessarily, it does mean taking 10 minutes to get up and walk. 

1. Investing is important and the younger you are, the more it's like a superpower. 

1. Financial health is important but the best investments are your relationships, your education, and your health -- both mental and physical. So treat your money accordingly. 

1. Don't let perfect be the enemy of the good.

1. With health - don't wait to learn and plan a fitness routine before trying to get healthy. You already know how to walk, run, and skip sodas and desserts. 

1. Similarly with financial health, you probably already know the basics. Spend less than you earn, and invest savings in a total market fund from Vanguard or Fidelity, and you're ahead of 75% of folks. 

1. Sometimes investing means spending money. If you need to get that degree get it, if you need to see the doctor go see them, if you need that exercise bike get it.

1. If you *don't* need to see the therapist go see them so that you'll already have a relationship with someone you trust when you *do* need them. 

1. Don't have zero days. If you're trying to learn an instrument, play one chord every day. If you are trying to get healthy do one situp every day. 

1. When you *do* have zero days, commit to having them and don't feel guilty. 

1. Don't mistake observation for experience.

1. A good sleep cycle and sleep hygiene is more important to your mental health than almost anything else. 

1. Economic security isn't the most important thing but if you don't have it it gets in the way of those more important things. 

1. Isolation is deadly.

1. Realize that anyone giving you advice is probably trying their best, but more than anything just trying to sound smart. So take it with a grain of salt

1. Always have a library card for your local library. Use it. And remember that most of them do *way* more than loan books.
